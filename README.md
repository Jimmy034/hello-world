# hello-world
First repository on GitHub... =)

Hi!

I'm Jimmy Paba, 28 y.o. A programmer, web developer, tech and literature reader, languages curious, fan of anything with an engine,  learning about using GitHub, in order to improve my abilities and knowledges for future jobs and tasks.

This is my first GitHub project so sorry if it isn't as amazing as more developed projects but.. Hey! it's my first time using GitHub. I hope to learn a lot with it and use it in my future tasks and work projects.

I wanna rock the world!!!
